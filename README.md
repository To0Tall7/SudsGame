This is our starting point -- save this in case of the need to restart at the beginning of the project development

Game: Suds (Name TBD)

Genre: Fighting Game/Platformer

Concept: What started as a meme quickly became a semester project. Suds is a game about fighting tough food and grease stains, all within a kitchen sink! We recognize that we’re all beginners here, so our plan is to keep it mechanically simple, and play into deliberately cringe art and sound design to create a solid ironic experience. Given that we’re a small group already, we intend to create only the bare minimum required to play for now, and if we have time, we’ll expand and add more content as we go!
